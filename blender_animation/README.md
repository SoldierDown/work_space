# Abstract
> The long-term goal for this project is to provide a **simple** and **straightforward** view of some basic concepts and structures in mathematics, physics, chemistry and engineering. We use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), an open-source and powerful tool to create those models and take advantage of its built-in [Cycles](https://www.cycles-renderer.org/) renderer to make every scene cool and vivid.
