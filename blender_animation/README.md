# Abstract
> The long-term goal for this project is to provide a **simple** and **straightforward** view of some basic concepts and structures in mathematics, physics, chemistry and engineering. We use [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), an open-source and powerful tool to create scientific models and take advantage of its built-in [Cycles](https://www.cycles-renderer.org/) renderer to make every scene cool and vivid.

## Möbius Strip
The Möbius strip or Möbius band, is a surface with only one side (when embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space) and only one boundary. The Möbius strip has the mathematical property of being unorientable. It can be realized as a ruled surface. *[from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B6bius_strip)]*
