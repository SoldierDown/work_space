# Abstract
> This project is for [CS523 Computer Graphics](https://orionquest.github.io/CS523/).  
> In this project, basic physical laws are implemented. The rigid solid cube will undergo movements, rotations, as well as collisions. 
> The following steps are included: 
> - Implement the unconstraint movements of a given rigid body. Use ODE to update properties like location, velocity, angular momentum, etc.
> - Take collisions into account and disallow inter-penetration.    
> - Typical result is shown below:
