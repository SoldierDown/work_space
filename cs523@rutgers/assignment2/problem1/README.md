# Abstract
> This project is for [CS523 Computer Graphics](https://orionquest.github.io/CS523/)  
> The following steps are included.
> - Given an input shape, specified using an analytic signed distance function, store it as a discrete signed distance function on the nodes of a uniform Cartesian grid.   
> - Given a random point in space, write routines to identify whether the point is inside or outside the shape.  
> - Project the point to the closest point on the surface of the shape.  
>View my [technical report](../report.pdf) for more details.
